# Better Default GitHub Lables
Dont like the default github labels? Me niether, so this is a template for a better labeling system based off of [this article](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63) (with some differences and additions).

Use this [GitHub label manager](http://www.dorukdestan.com/github-label-manager/) for easy label copy/paste between repositories.
